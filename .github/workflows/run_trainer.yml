Looking at the workflow YAML, I can see the error. The issue is on line 55, which is:

```yaml
if: always()
```

The problem: In GitHub Actions, the always() function requires the ${{ }} expression syntax when used in if conditions. You're missing the expression syntax markers.

Fix it by changing line 55 to:

```yaml
if: ${{ always() }}
```

Here's why this happens:

1. always() is a GitHub Actions context function that returns true whether the previous steps succeeded or failed
2. Without ${{ }}, GitHub tries to parse it as a literal string, which causes a syntax error
3. The ${{ }} syntax tells GitHub to evaluate it as an expression

The corrected section should look like:

```yaml
      - name: Send Completion Alert
        if: ${{ always() }}
        run: python send_alert.py
```

Additional note: You should also fix line 60 for consistency (though it might work without ${{ }} since it's a simpler comparison):

```yaml
if: ${{ steps.trainer.outcome == 'success' }}
```

And line 75:

```yaml
if: ${{ steps.trainer.outcome == 'success' && steps.check-db.outputs.changes == 'true' }}
```

This will resolve the YAML syntax error and make your workflow run correctly.
